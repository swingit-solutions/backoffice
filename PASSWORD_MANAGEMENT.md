# Password Management in Supabase

This document explains how passwords are managed in our application using Supabase.

## How Passwords Are Stored

Supabase uses PostgreSQL's authentication system (Supabase Auth) to handle user authentication. Here's how passwords are managed:

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are **never** stored in plain text. They are hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms (bcrypt) and stored securely in Supabase Auth.

2. **Database Access**: You won't find passwords in your database tables. They are stored in a separate, secure system managed by Supabase.

3. **Security Best Practices**: Supabase follows industry best practices for password storage, including:
   - Salting passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks
   - Using strong hashing algorithms
   - Rate limiting login attempts
   - Implementing proper access controls

## Password Reset Flow

Our application implements a secure password reset flow:

1. **User Requests Reset**: User enters their email on the reset password page
2. **Email Delivery**: Supabase sends a secure, time-limited reset link to the user's email
3. **Verification**: When the user clicks the link, they are redirected to our application with a special token
4. **Token Validation**: Our application validates the token with Supabase
5. **Password Update**: User enters a new password, which is securely updated in Supabase Auth

## Security Considerations

- Reset links expire after 24 hours
- Each reset link can only be used once
- Password requirements enforce strong passwords (minimum 8 characters)
- All password-related operations are logged for security auditing

## Troubleshooting

If users have issues with password reset:

1. Check that the reset email isn't in spam/junk folders
2. Verify that the user is using the link within 24 hours
3. Ensure the user completes the entire reset process on the same device/browser
4. If issues persist, they can request another reset link

## Implementation Details

Our implementation uses Supabase's built-in authentication methods:

- `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` - Sends the reset email
- `supabase.auth.updateUser()` - Updates the user's password
- `supabase.auth.getSession()` - Validates the reset token

These methods handle all the security concerns automatically, ensuring a secure password management system.
