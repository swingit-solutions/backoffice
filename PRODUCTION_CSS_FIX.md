# Production CSS Loading Fix

This document outlines the solution implemented to fix CSS loading issues in the production environment.

## Problem

CSS styles were loading correctly in the local development environment but not in the production environment on Vercel. This resulted in unstyled components and a poor user experience.

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to ensure proper CSS loading in production:

1. **Updated the Root Layout**:
   - Added a direct link to the CSS file with high precedence
   - Ensured proper meta tags for viewport settings

2. **Modified Next.js Configuration**:
   - Added experimental CSS optimization
   - Removed custom webpack configuration that was interfering with CSS processing
   - Disabled powered-by header and etag generation for cleaner responses

3. **Updated Vercel Configuration**:
   - Added proper cache control headers for static assets
   - Ensured CSS files are properly cached by browsers
   - Configured routes to handle all paths correctly

## Verification

After implementing these changes, verify that:
- CSS is loading correctly in the production environment
- The styling matches what you see in local development
- No console errors related to CSS loading are present

## Troubleshooting

If CSS issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any loading errors
2. Verify that the CSS file paths in the layout match the actual build output
3. Try clearing the Vercel build cache and redeploying
4. Ensure all dependencies related to CSS processing are properly installed
